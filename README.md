# FEP

A game based on a disease called FEP which causes the body to replace ligaments with bones when healing.

This is an open world survival and base building game in which the player must fend off zombies with FEP.


Usually, the player can heal just fine, but after the first time the player is hit by a zombie, they start to loose functionality after healing depending on the limb they damage.

The player must build a base, collect weapons and medical equipment, and avoid taking damage in order to survive as long as possible.
